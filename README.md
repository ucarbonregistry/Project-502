# Project-502
Wastewater Recycling &amp; Reuse Project by Veerapandi CETP, Tirupur

The project activity is titled – “Wastewater Recycling & Reuse Project by Veerapandi CETP,
Tirupur”. The project is located in Veerapandi Village, Tirupur South Taluk, Tirupur, Tirupur
District, Tamil Nadu State, India.

UWR Scope: Scope 5: Conservation measures taken to
recycle and/or reuse water, spent washing
wastewater etc. across or within specific
industrial processes and systems, including
wastewater recycled/ reused in a different
process, but within the same site or location
of the project activity. Recycled wastewater
used in off-site landscaping, gardening or tree
plantations/forests activity are also eligible
under this Scope.

The project activity plant incorporates Veerapandi Commen Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP).
The primary purpose of this project is to effectively treat the effluent generated from their dyeing
and printing processes.

Tirupur is an industrial town located about 450 kms Southwest of the city of Chennai, Tamil
Nadu State. Tirupur is famous as one of the top knitwear exports centers of India. The primary
purpose of this project is to effectively treat the effluent generated from their dyeing and printing
processes

The Veerapandi Effluent Treatment Plant, with an installed capacity of 12 MLD and an
operational capacity of 10.75MLD, was commissioned from March 5th, 2008 onwards and the
CETP located at S.F.NO.548/1A, Veerapandi Village, Tirupur South Taluk, Tirupur, Tirupur
District., 641604, treats the raw effluent by Lime and Ferrous Sulphate (one stage chemical
treatment resulting in sludge) before discharging the treated effluent into the Noyyal river basin.
Subsequently the CETP planned ZLD scheme & got approval of the scheme with details given
in September 2006 and amendment on 19" June 2007. The members changing the use of
sodium sulphate instead of common salt with the plan to recover sodium sulphate salt for reuse.
The plant has upgraded its units to achieve ZLD.

B-1 Biological treatment (Extended aeration process) with mechanical sludge dewatering.

B-2 Oxidation (0 R) in HDPE reactor with Chlorine gas as the oxidant.

B-3 Its subsequent reduction by Sodium Meta Bi Sulphate (SMBS) before leaving the reactor

B-4 Coagulation & settlement of the residues of the oxidation-reduction reaction & Hardness
removal.

B-5 Interface treatment by dual media filter, ultrafiltration membrane & activated carbon filter.

B-6 Sequential 3 stage R.O membranes to recover 90% of the raw effluent as permeate.

B-7 Hardness removal from R.O rejects

B-8 Accelerated evaporation of R.0 reject by Multistage falling and two stage forced film
Mechanical Evaporator followed by crystallizer, centrifuge and a salt drier for mixed salt and
recovering sodium sulphate salt for reuse.

B-9 Disposing the sludge in upcoming landfill being put up by the Federation of CETPs, Tirupur
